    \item \textbf{Potential AI Chat-bot}
            \\\medskip
                \item[--] The interviewer, who is claiming to be human, is responding in a time frame that is unrealistic to expect from a real person.
            \\\medskip
                \item[--] When texting Sam was asked for certain keywords which would serve as a prompt for the chat-bot to generate text tailored to their current conversation \hyperref[sec:Fig7]{(See Figure 7)}.
            \\\medskip
    \item \textbf{Inconsistent Information}
            \\\medskip
                \item[--] Neither Mr. Bondeson, Mr. Manly, or Ms. McDaniel ever refer to HealthComp by it's new name, Personify Health.
            \\\medskip
                \item[--] The original interview offer Sam received was from HealthComp, LLC. Upon entering the interview, it was revealed that she was actually interviewing for a company called Omnicell \hyperref[sec:Fig8]{(See Figure 8)}.

            \\\medskip
                \item[--] The job offer letter Sam received was for HealthComp, which was consistent with the initial email, but not with the text based interview.
    \item \textbf{Point of Contact Discrepancies}
            \\\medskip
                \item[--] As stated in the email sent from HealthComp, LLC, the point of contact for this interview was supposed to be Mr. David W. Bondeson; however, the interviewer introduces himself as Mr. Gavin Manley from Omnicell, Inc. despite having the contact name "david donbenson" in Teams \hyperref[sec:Fig10]{(See Figure 10)}.
            \\\medskip
                \item[--] In the interview, Mr. Manley Introduces himself to be from Omnicell, Inc., but according to his Linkedin profile, he's currently employed at Docusign as a Senior Enterpise Account Executive \hyperref[sec:Fig2]{(See Figure 2)}.
            \\\medskip
                \item[--] When introducing himself, Mr. Manley states that he received his Bachelor of Science in Electrical Engineering from the Swiss University of Applied Science, Winterthur \hyperref[sec:Fig11]{(See Figure 11)}. This information is inconsistent with Mr. Manleyâ€™s LinkedIn profile indicates that he received a Bachelor of Science in Business Administration from the University of Central Florida \hyperref[sec:Fig3]{(See Figure 3)}.
            \\\medskip 
                \item[--] During his time at Omnicell, Mr. Manley was a Medical Account Executive and not on the board of directors as he claims in the interview \hyperref[sec:Fig2]{(See Figure 2)}. 
            \\\medskip
                \item[--] Mr. Bondeson's title at HealthComp, LLC. is Director of Stop Loss sales and not Interview Manager \hyperref[sec:Fig4]{(See Figure 4)}.
            \\\medskip

            \\\medskip

    \item  \textbf{Professionalism}
            \\\medskip
                \item[--] Numerous grammar \hyperref[sec:Fig12]{(See Figures 12-13)}, spelling \hyperref[sec:Fig14]{(See Figure 14)}, and convention errors \hyperref[sec:Fig15]{(See Figure 15)}.

                \item[--] Email signed by HealthComp instead of the sender or an HR Representative \hyperref[sec:Fig16]{(See Figure 16)}.
                \item[--] Lack of branding on throughout all contact, most companies will usually include a header, footer, and logo in their emails. 
            \\\medskip            
                \item[--] The contact name on the Microsoft Teams chat reads, "david donbenson" and not "David Bondeson," lacking proper capitalization and spelling of the last name provided in the original email \hyperref[sec:Fig17]{(See Figure 17}). 
    \item   \textbf{Lure}
            \\\medskip
                \item[--] Offer letter states Sam will have to purchase her own office equipment from a supplied vendor and will be reimbursed, which is a common scam acknowledged by the Federal Trade Commission.
