\begin{enumerate}
     \item Cease contact with anyone claiming to be from Omnicell or HealthComp.
     \item Do not provide the employer with any payment information or personally identifiable information (PII) such as your address, social security number or photo.
    \item[--] A remote position should not require you to have an employee identification card. Providing a scammer with a picture as well as other forms of PII such as a social security number or address opens pathways to multiple forms of identity theft.
    \item Do not pay for any items which the company says it will reimburse you for as this matches with a common scam profile acknowledged by the \href{https://consumer.ftc.gov/articles/job-scams#what%20to%20do
}{Federal Trade Commission}

	\textbf{\LARGE ``}No honest potential employer will ever send you a check to deposit and then tell you to send on part of the money, or buy gift cards with it. Thatâ€™s a fake check scam. The check will bounce, and the bank will want you to repay the amount of the fake check.\textbf{''}
