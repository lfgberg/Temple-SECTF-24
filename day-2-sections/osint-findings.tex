\subsection{BBB Scam Report}

The team found a report submitted to the Better Business Bureau which fits the exact description of Sam's interactions with the prospective employer.

\begin{quote}
	\textbf{\LARGE ``}I was sent an email about a potential job offer for HealthComp I then got instructions to conduct an interview on Microsoft Team then they so called hired me and had me fill out paper work including a W4 form that had my ssn number then after that I told them I had finished filling out the paper work and then they started asking if I was going to be using a credit card to accept my payments and I said no then they said I need one so they can process faster then that's when I realized it was a scam\textbf{''}
	
	\hfill--- BBB Scam ID \#772647 \autocite{BBB:2023}
\end{quote}

The BBB Scam Report lists the same davidbondeson@healthcomp.live email address referenced in Sam's interview offer. With this in mind, it's extremely likely that Sam's job opportunity is not legitimate.
