The CARE Lab fraud fighters team was solicited to assist a young student, Sam, with determining the legitimacy of a job opportunity she recently received. During the first day of the engagement the team met with Sam's friends to gather background information on both the employment opportunity and Sam.\\\medskip

Sam initially posted her resume on an online job seeking site, after which she was quickly contacted by Kellie McDaniel. McDaniel claimed to be from HealthComp, a healthcare solutions company. Sam received an offer to interview for six different positions with David W. Bondeson who was identified as the "Interview Manager". The positions were offered as either full or part time, and fully remote.\\\medskip

The team built a comprehensive profile of the prospective employer, assembled a timeline of events, identified a number of potential red flags, and created a plan to assist Sam throughout the rest of the job seeking process. Notably, the team identified a number of red flags, and a Better Business Bureau scam report consistent with the profile of Sam's prospective employer. With this in mind, the team recommends that should Sam choose to move forward she do so hesitantly, and should consult with the fraud fighting team before disclosing any sensitive information.
