\subsection{Employer Profile}
HealthComp is a third-party administrator for healthcare solutions founded in 1994 which helps employers make informed financial decisions regarding self-funded health plans for employees. HealthComp and Virgin Pulse, another healthcare solutions company, merged in November of 2023 in a \$3 billion deal to create a company that uses technology and AI to create health plan designs that improve member health and lower costs \autocite{VirginPulse:2023}. Beginning February of 2024 the merger between Virgin Pulse and HealthComp started its transition to the Personify Health name and brand \autocite{PersonifyHealth:2024}.\\\medskip

HealthComp utilizes an \href{https://careers-virginpulse.icims.com/jobs/intro}{online careers portal} under the banner of Personify Health for its job postings and applications. All of their currently posted remote job listings are full time, and provide a salary range along with detailed descriptions of needed qualifications and duties \autocite{VirginPulse:2024}. The team found no indication that HealthComp commonly solicits interviews without an application.

\subsection{Scammer Profile}
As it pertains to Sam's employment, all emails received only reference HealthComp with no mention of the new brand name, Personify Health. Additionally, the email provided to contact, Mr. David W. Bondeson, is directed towards the email domain @healthcomp.live; however, all contact within the company comes from the @healthcomp.com domain, as seen through the real David W. Bondeson's Linkedin page. \\\medskip

The message from McDaniel promises flexibility that is not found within the Personify Health job listings. It is also worth noting that the positions referenced in the email: Customer Service Representative, Executive Assistant, Human Resource Assistant, Project Manager, Administrative Assistant, Data Entry, and Content Writer, do not appear on either LinkedIn or the internal job board as well for Personify Health.
