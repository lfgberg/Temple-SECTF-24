The team's goal is to help guide Sam through this potential job scam using the evidence collected from OSINT and today's preliminary interview. During the rest of Sam's hiring process the team intends to guide her through the interview, and prevent Sam from falling victim to an employment scam.\\\medskip

During the interview the team will continue to evaluate the interaction to see if it is consistent with the characteristics of a job scam. Specifically, it's imperative to see if the interview and hiring process follow the same formula outlined in the \hyperref[sec:BBB Scam Report]{BBB Scam Report}. If this is the case, the team will advise Sam not to disclose any sensitive or personal information in order to avoid both financial loss and identity theft.\\\medskip

Additionally, the team plans to educate Sam on the different types of common job scams to better equip her for the rest of her job search. The team will develop a guide on identifying scams and fraud, and checklists for victims of scams that Sam can utilize in the future. It's encouraged that Sam take a proactive approach to preventing these scams in the future, by scrutinizing suspicious opportunities, and avoiding posting publicly.
